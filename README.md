# rock-paper-scissors

Project made as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

Main difficulties

Writing the code to play a single match and logging it to the console/alert/etc was easy, I mostly struggled with making the playGame() function work properly.

At first, it was only taking into account the first match adn repeating the player/computer picks for the other matches. I figured I had to implement some sort of gameOver() function to reset the pick value, but no amtter what I tried I just couldn find a decent way to do that.In hindsight I could probably have written the gameOver() function as:

function gameOver() {
computerSelection = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];
let userInput = prompt("Pick rock, paper or scissors: ");
let playerSelection = userInput.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + userInput.slice(1).toLowerCase();
}

And then I could call it in the playGame() function. I'Äºl now go and test it to see if it works (SPOILER: it does!).

I renamed it to choiceReset() though, it seems more intuitive than "gameOver()".

Optimization

Another problem I had was trying to use arrow functions to get used to it, but it created more issues than it solved, so I decided to stick with the regular syntax. I might revisit this and refactor everything once I understand arrow functions better.

I'm sure there are hundreds of other little things I could have done to make this more straightforward, but I'm happy with the result for now.

The "game" takes place mostly in the console, but there's some kind of interface with the alert boxes.

I do gladly accept criticism though. I want to become a better programmer and eventually work in the field, so feel free to point out what I could have done better and I will.

Working on the UI now.
